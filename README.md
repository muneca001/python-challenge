# School Performance Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes school performance data using Python to extract key metrics, perform calculations, and generate insights on student achievement across multiple schools.

## Features
- **District Summary**: Computes total number of schools, students, budget, average test scores, and pass percentages.
- **School Summary**: Analyzes school type, student count, per capita spending, and passing rates.
- **Performance Rankings**:
  - Identifies top and bottom-performing schools by overall passing percentage.
- **Grade-Level Performance**:
  - Breaks down math and reading scores by grade level.
- **Performance by Spending & Size**:
  - Groups schools based on spending and size to assess their impact on student performance.
- **Performance by School Type**:
  - Analyzes test scores based on school type (public/private).
- **Data Visualization & Formatting**:
  - Uses pandas to create structured DataFrames for clear presentation.

## How to Run
1. Load the dataset into a Python environment.
2. Run the script (`main.py`) found both in PyBank and PyPoll folders.
3. View the results in the generated DataFrame outputs.

## Analysis Results
To view the results, navigate to:

- (`PyPoll/Analysis/election_results.txt`)
- (`PyBank/Analysis/financial_analysis.txt`)

These files contain key insights and statistical findings based on the analysis. It provides a foundation for further research into the factors that influence student success and how resource allocation affects educational outcomes.

# python-challenge

The python-challenge folder contains data analysis for two different csv files for the PyBank and PyPoll data. In each of the sub folders, one can find my coding solutions in the main.py file, the data in a resources folder, and analysis as a text file.

Data for this dataset was generated by edX Boot Camps LLC, and is intended for educational purposes only.
